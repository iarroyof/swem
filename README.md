# Support Word Embedding Machines (SWEM)
This work is an essay to rewrite word embedding algorithms. This method initially aims to give word embedding insights 
in terms of indetificability and mathematical structure if the resulting embeddings. This can allow us to study more 
critical aspects of word embeddings such that linguistic information providing well performance in different applications.
